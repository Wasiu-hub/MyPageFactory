i- run-up file: contains how to run the project- run configurations
ii- feature file: contains test cases written in Gherkin language (simple English)
iii- step definition file: where step definitions are written with java code logic.

-- In Cucumber, you are not allowed to extend classes that define the Step Definition, or Hooks- they both have annotations.

Objective here:
-- how to build our own custom locator (xpath) i.e finding element using our own custom locator (xpath)

Three ways to find element locator:
i- manually selecting elements in the DOM three (legacy method)
ii- chropath
iii- custom built

-- validating the custom locator, key to open search bar is (command + f) in Mac

-- Hooks contains functions to be invoked before or after our test (test case) executes

-- Page Factory Pattern makes selection easier
-- Gherkin ia a plugin to intellij which helps to speed up writing our feature files
-- Maven creates a project with a simple Java capabilities

-- Junit is used to run our test suite and to compare actual and expected result.
-- selenium to run or interact with web element
-- webDriver to do driver configuration
--- Cucumber Java and Cucumber Junit is used to build step definitions
-- pom.xml is Maven configuration file where dependencies are specified


-Validating custom locator- you can open the search bar by entering the customized locator-

-- You can find the locator using the parent of the element.
